@article{StreckaJozef2015Abao,
abstract = {Acta Physics Slovaca 65 (2015) 235-367 The article provides a tutorial review on how to treat Ising models within
mean-field (MF), effective-field (EF) and exact methods. MF solutions of the
spin-1 Blume-Capel (BC) model and the mixed-spin Ising model demonstrate a
change of continuous phase transitions to discontinuous ones at a tricritical
point. A quantum phase transition of the spin-S Ising model driven by a
transverse field is explored within MF method. EF theory is elaborated within a
single- and two-spin cluster approach to demonstrate an efficiency of this
approximate method. The long-standing problem of this method concerned with a
self-consistent determination of the free energy is addressed. EF theory is
adapted for the spin-1/2 Ising model, the spin-S BC model and the transverse
Ising model. The particular attention is paid to continuous and discontinuous
transitions. Exact results for the spin-1/2 Ising chain, spin-1 BC chain and
mixed-spin Ising chain are obtained using the transfer-matrix method, the
crucial steps of which are reviewed for a spin-1/2 Ising square lattice.
Critical points of the spin-1/2 Ising model on several lattices are rigorously
obtained with the help of dual, star-triangle and decoration-iteration
transformations. Mapping transformations are adapted to obtain exact results
for the mixed-spin Ising model on planar lattices. An increase in the
coordination number of the mixed-spin Ising model on decorated planar lattices
gives rise to reentrant transitions, while the critical temperature of the
mixed-spin Ising model on a regular honeycomb lattice is always greater than
that of two semi-regular archimedean lattices. The effect of selective site
dilution of the mixed-spin Ising model on a honeycomb lattice upon phase
diagrams is examined. The review affords a brief account of the Ising models
solved within MF, EF and exact methods along with a few comments on their
future applicability.},

abstract = {Abstract A model for hemoglobin is proposed and its application to allosteric enzymes is discussed with particular reference to asparate transcarbamylase. The main assumptions made are that the molecule is composed of subunits and that occupation of a sub-unit produces a conformational change which affects the occupational probability of neighboring subunits. The results compare favorably with experiment and a number of specific predictions are made for aspartate transcarbamylase.},
