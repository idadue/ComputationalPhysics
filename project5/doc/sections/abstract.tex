We develop a Monte Carlo simulation of the spread of an infectious disease. The aim of creating such a simulation is to investigate how a disease spreads throughout a given population over time. As a learning exercise, we include a deterministic approach using the fourth-order Rung-Kutta method.  We study the effect of differing $b$ on four sample populations and find that 
Four populations with three modifications to the simple SIRS model are studied; vital dynamics, seasonal variations and vaccine. Our simulations/findings show ...
