In this project we determine numerically the paths of the planetary bodies in the solar system, using the Euler and velocity Verlet methods. Various parameters and known constants are tested, such as the escape velocity of the Earth from the gravitational field of the Sun which is found to correspond accurately with the analytic value. The three-body-problem with Jupiter is simulated with different masses of Jupiter, transitioning into a binary star-like system at a mass $1000 M_j$. A generalized force of gravity is simulated for stability, corresponding largely with theory. We simulate and plot the perihelion precession of Mercury with and without relativistic correction, and find a correspondence with the observed values to an error of $\approx 10''$. The code has been created in an object oriented way, to ensure re-usability of functions and to learn better ways to structure code. Further work could involve generalizing the code even more to be applicable to for instance molecular dynamics.
